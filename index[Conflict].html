                      <p>I was born in a small hamlet in the south of France. Orphaned at the age of 3, I don't remember my real parents. I was raised in a convent by Nuns. The sisters were very kind, but I always felt like I was missing something. I felt no connection of family or country or God. At 17 I decided to leave France
  
                          For many moons I backpacked around Europe, sleeping outside many nights, finding odd jobs for enough money to keep me fed, if not always sheltered. I met some wonderful people, and plenty of the opposite. I spent a lot of time observing groups of families and friends, dissecting what I could of the relationships I saw. After several years of drifting, I came to the decision that I was not missing anything after all. Turns out I don't much need that after all.
                          
                          Having quenched my wanderlust, and growing weary of Europe, I decided to find new fortunes in the US. I spent some time in England saving up enough money for a plane ride and ended up in New England, which I somehow fell in love with. I got a more permanent job at a machine factory, and started to set down roots.... and lo.. build a family after all... ...by which I mean me and 3 pups.
                          
                          Of course no one changes, all the while, neither staying the same. At the factory, I began to get close with one of my coworkers. 17 years later, I have a family after all. I'm in love and married and perhaps I don't dislike people after all. I suppose anything is possible.</p>
